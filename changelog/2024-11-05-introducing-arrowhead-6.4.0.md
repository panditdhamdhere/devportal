**Summary**: 

The Rootstock community is pleased to announce the release of the latest version of the RSKj client, which is now available in the [RSKj GitHub repository](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/releases/tag/ARROWHEAD-6.4.0). This update introduces the **fiat-stable minimum gas price feature** (disabled by default), enabling mining pools to automatically adjust their minimum gas price configuration based on the price of Bitcoin. Additionally, it includes JSON-RPC interface improvements and dependency upgrades.

> Note that this upgrade is optional, however it is strongly recommended that users update their nodes to the latest version to benefit from enhanced performance and security.
