description: The PowPeg is a user-friendly interface for the conversion of BTC to RBTC and vice versa. It is secured by the powpeg protocol, which is a unique 2-way peg system that allows users to natively transfer bitcoins from the Bitcoin blockchain to the Rootstock blockchain and vice versa, creating a token called RBTC that is pegged to the value of Bitcoin.

## General

<Accordion>
  <Accordion.Item eventKey="0">
    <Accordion.Header as="h3">1. What is RBTC Flyover?</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Body>
      - RBTC Flyover is an innovative protocol built on top of the Rootstock network that significantly speeds up the process of transferring Bitcoin (BTC) to Rootstock Bitcoin (RBTC). It achieves this by leveraging a pool of liquidity providers who hold both BTC and RBTC, enabling near-instantaneous transfers with minimal confirmations.
    </Accordion.Body>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item eventKey="1">
    <Accordion.Header as="h3">2. How does Flyover compare to the traditional PowPeg?</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Body>
      - The PowPeg requires a lengthy 100-block confirmation period for security, resulting in transfer times of around 16 hours. Flyover, on the other hand, can be configured by the Liquidity Provider to be as low as 2 block confirmations (depending on the liquidity provider), reducing transfer times significantly to as low as 10-20 minutes.
      - Note: For peg outs, LPs will need to wait for 2 Bitcoin block confirmations before receiving a refund.
    </Accordion.Body>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item eventKey="2">
    <Accordion.Header as="h3">3. Is Flyover secure?</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Body>
      - Yes, Flyover is built on top of the proven security of the PowPeg. It inherits the same security guarantees while offering significantly faster transfer speeds.

## For Liquidity Providers

<Accordion>
<Accordion.Item eventKey="0">
    <Accordion.Header as="h3">7. How do I become a Liquidity Provider?</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Body>
        - To become a Liquidity Provider (LP), you'll need to set up and run the Liquidity Provider Service (LPS). Once the LPS is operational, it will automatically register itself with the configured wallet address. See [how to get started as an LP](/developers/integrate/flyover/LP/get-started/).
    </Accordion.Body>
  </Accordion.Item>
<Accordion.Item eventKey="1">
    <Accordion.Header as="h3">8. Whatâ€™s the minimum recommended amount of Liquidity?</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Body>
       - The minimum required collateral is **0.06 RBTC**, regardless of the total liquidity provided. This collateral is paid upon transaction registration. The recommended amount of liquidity depends on the anticipated volume of concurrent operations the LP wishes to support. A higher liquidity level enables the LP to handle more transactions simultaneously.
       - Note: For peg outs, LPs will need to wait for 2 Bitcoin block confirmations before receiving a refund.
    </Accordion.Body>
  </Accordion.Item>
  <Accordion.Item eventKey="8">
    <Accordion.Header as="h3">9. Can I become both an integrator and a Liquidity Provider?</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Body>
        - Yes, you can integrate Flyover into your platform and simultaneously act as a Liquidity Provider. This allows you to benefit from both sides of the system by maintaining control over liquidity management, potentially reducing costs, and creating synergies within your platform. To achieve this, integrate the Flyover SDK, configure your own LPS, and direct user transactions to your LPS within your platform's code.

    <Accordion.Item eventKey="9">
    <Accordion.Header as="h3">10. What are the benefits of being a Liquidity Provider?</Accordion.Header>
    <Accordion.Body>
        - As a liquidity provider, you contribute to the growth of the Rootstock ecosystem while earning fees on every transfer facilitated through your liquidity. You also gain exposure to a wider user base.
