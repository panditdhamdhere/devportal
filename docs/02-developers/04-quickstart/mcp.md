## Installation and Build

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rsksmart/rsk-mcp-server
cd rsk-mcp-server
```

\> See the [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rsksmart/rsk-mcp-server)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
```

This command:
- Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript in the `build/` folder
- Makes the main file executable (`build/index.js`)

### Verify Installation

```bash
node build/index.js
```

You should see the following response:

```bash
# node build/index.js
DevX MCP Server running on stdio
```

> **Important Note:** For local running this MCP, your client will point to the `index.js` file created on the `build` folder after building it.

## Configuring the MCP Server

There are two ways to configure the MCP Server:
* Local Configuration using AI clients such as Claude or Cursor  
* Remote Configuration using publicly available endpoint

Note: You will use this Model Context Protocol Server from a LLM Client (e.g Cursor, Claude, Warp, etc) which needs to be compatible with the MCP standard.

For detailed set up instructions, please refer to the [MCP Server README](https://github.com/rsksmart/rsk-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-ai-client-configuration) AI Client configuration guide.

:::tip[Connect Remotely to MCP Server using NPM]

For remote configurations with AI clients like cursor and claude, connect using the [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rsksmart/rsk-mcp-server).

**Prompt: I want to deploy a contract on Rootstock Testnet**

**AI Response**: ‚ÄúExcellent\! I'll help you deploy a smart contract to the Rootstock blockchain using your imported TestWallet.‚Äù

**Next Step:**

To deploy a contract, I need the following information:

```text
Required Information:

**Network Selection:**

* **Testnet** (recommended for testing) \- Free transactions  
* **Mainnet** \- Real transactions with costs

**Contract ABI:**

* The JSON ABI (Application Binary Interface) of your contract  
* This defines the contract's functions and structure

**Contract Bytecode:**

## MCP Operations

This section explains the core functions of the MCP server and how to use or integrate into your application.

### Wallet Management: 

This section shows you how to manage your wallets, including creating new ones, importing existing ones, and switching between them. Your wallet holds your crypto assets and is needed to sign transactions on the blockchain.

**Create a New Wallet:** You can create a new wallet by giving it a name and a secure password. This will generate a new address for you to use on Rootstock.

**Reference**:`validateCreateWallet(params)`, `processWalletOperation(params)`

```ts
// In WalletService.ts
// Example parameters for creating a new wallet
{
  walletOption: "üÜï Create a new wallet",
  walletName: "MyNewWallet",
  walletPassword: "secure_password",
  replaceCurrentWallet: false
}
```

**Import an Existing Wallet**: If you already have a wallet, you can import it using its private key. You'll also need to set a new password to keep it secure on the server.

**Reference**: 

* `validateImportWallet(params)`  
* `processWalletOperation(params)`

```ts
// In WalletService.ts
// Example parameters for importing a wallet

{
  walletOption: "üîë Import existing wallet",
  walletName: "ImportedWallet",
  privateKey: "0x...",
  walletPassword: "secure_password"
}
```

**List Saved Wallets**: This shows a list of all the wallets you've previously saved on the server.

**Reference**:

* `validateListWallets(params)`  
* `processWalletOperation(params)`

```ts
// In WalletService.ts
// Example parameters for listing wallets
{
  walletOption: "üîç List saved wallets",
  walletData: "my-wallets.json_content"
}
```

**Switch Wallets:** If you have multiple wallets, you can use this function to change which one is currently active for your next operation.

**Reference**: 

* `validateSwitchWallet(params)`  
* `processWalletOperation(params)`

```ts
// In WalletService.ts
// Example parameters for switching wallets
{
  walletOption: "üîÅ Switch wallet",
  newMainWallet: "WalletName",
  walletData: "my-wallets.json_content"
}
```

### Balance Queries:

This function checks the balance of a specific token in your wallet. It is handled within the `WalletService.ts` file using the `balanceCommand`.

**Reference**: `checkBalanceFromCreation(params)`

```ts
// In WalletService.ts
// Example parameters for checking rBTC balance
{
  testnet: true,
  token: "rBTC",
  walletCreationResult: "..." // JSON result from a wallet creation
}

// Example parameters for a custom token balance
{
  testnet: true,
  token: "Custom Token",
  customTokenAddress: "0x...", // contract address of the token
  walletCreationResult: "..."
}
```

**Supported Tokens:** You can check the balance for `rBTC` (Rootstock's native token) and other popular ERC20 tokens like `USDT`, `DOC`, and `RIF`. You can also check the balance of any other ERC20 token by providing its contract address.

**How to check a balance:** Simply tell the AI which token you want to check and for which wallet. For example, you can ask for the `rBTC` balance in your wallet named MyWallet.

**Custom Tokens:** For a token that isn't on the standard list, you'll need to provide its unique contract address on the blockchain.

### Transaction Tracking:

This tool lets you check the status of a transaction on the Rootstock blockchain. To use it, you need the unique transaction hash (also called a TXID).

How it works: You provide the transaction hash, and the server checks the blockchain to give you information like:

* Whether the transaction is `pending`, `confirmed`, or `failed`.  
* The block number where the transaction was included.  
* Details about the transfer.  
* The exact time of the transaction.

![Create New Wallet Prompt](/img/developers/use-cases/ai/2-mcp-create-new-wallet.gif)

### Contract Deployment:

This function allows you to deploy a smart contract on the Rootstock network. A smart contract is a self-executing program that runs on the blockchain.

**Requirements:** To deploy a contract, you'll need three main things:

* The **ABI** (Application Binary Interface): A file that explains the contract's functions in a human-readable format.  
* The **Bytecode**: The compiled, machine-readable version of your contract's code.  
* Your **Wallet**: The wallet you use for deployment must have enough rBTC to cover the transaction fees.

**Process:** You provide the ABI and bytecode, along with any arguments the contract's constructor needs, and the server handles sending it to the network.

**Reference**: 

* `processContractDeployment(params)`  
* `executeDeployment(...)`

```ts
// In ContractDeploymentService.ts
// Example parameters for deploying a contract
{
  testnet: true,
  abiContent: `[{"inputs":[],"name":"myFunction"...}]`, // The contract's ABI
  bytecodeContent: "0x...", // The contract's compiled bytecode
  constructorArgs: ["arg1", "arg2"], // Optional constructor arguments
  walletData: "my-wallets.json_content",
  walletPassword: "wallet_password"
}
```

### Contract Verification:

Verifying a contract makes its code public and visible to everyone. This builds trust by proving that the code you deployed matches the original source code. The core logic is in the `ContractVerificationService.ts` file.

**Requirements:** To verify a contract, you'll need:

* The **contract address** where it was deployed.  
* The original **Solidity source code**.  
* The **compilation metadata** (a JSON file that describes how your code was compiled).  
* The **constructor arguments** used when you first deployed the contract.

**Outcome:** After verification, anyone can view the contract's code on a blockchain explorer and confirm it's correct.

**Reference**: 

* `processContractVerification(params)`  
* `executeVerification(...)`

```ts
// In ContractVerificationService.ts
// Example parameters for verifying a contract
{
  testnet: true,
  contractAddress: "0x...",
  contractName: "MyContract",
  jsonContent: `{"language":"Solidity","sources":{...}}`, // Compilation metadata
  constructorArgs: ["arg1", "arg2"] // Arguments used during deployment
}
```

### Read Contracts

This tool lets you interact with smart contracts that have already been deployed and verified. You can use it to get information from the contract without sending a transaction.

* **List Functions:** You can start by asking the AI to list all the available functions within a verified contract.  
* **Call a Function:** You can then call a specific function, providing any required arguments. For example, you could call the balanceOf function to check the token balance of a specific address within that contract.

**Reference**: 

* `processContractRead(params)`  
* `executeContractRead(...)`

```ts
// In ContractReadService.ts
// Example parameters for calling a function on a contract
{
  testnet: true,
  contractAddress: "0x...",
  functionName: "balanceOf", // The name of a 'view' or 'pure' function
  functionArgs: ["0x..."] // Arguments for the function
}
```

See detailed functionality and supported operations in the [README](https://github.com/rsksmart/rsk-mcp-server?tab=readme-ov-file#-detailed-functionality) or the [Rootstock CLI documentation](https://dev.rootstock.io/developers/smart-contracts/rsk-cli/).

## Troubleshooting
