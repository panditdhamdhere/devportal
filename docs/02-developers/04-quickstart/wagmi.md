```

The `src` folder is organized to streamline the development process and make it easy to locate specific code or assets. Here's a detailed breakdown:

#### `.src` Folder Structure
- **Assets:** Contains the ABIs (Application Binary Interfaces) for ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155.
- **Components:**
  - **AccountAbstraction:** Contains code related to account abstraction.
  - **Home:** Holds components specific to the homepage.
  - **Icons:** Contains various icon components.
  - **Tokens:** Includes components for different token types.
  - **UI:** General UI components used across the application.
  - **Footers.tsx:** Footer component.
  - **Navbar.tsx:** Navbar component.
- **Config:**
  - **provider.tsx:** Configuration for providers.
  - **rainbowkitConfig.ts:** Configuration for RainbowKit.
  - **wagmiProviderConfig.ts:** Configuration for WAGMI providers.
- **Lib:** Contains various utility folders for easy organization:
  - **Constants:** Application constants.
  - **Functions:** General functions used across the app.
  - **Types:** Type definitions.
  - **Utils:** Utility functions.
- **Pages:**
  - **index.ts:** Main entry point.
  - **Etherspot.tsx:** Page component for Etherspot.
  - **Home.tsx:** Homepage component.
  - **Wagmi.tsx:** Wagmi-related page component.

### Code for ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 Tabs
The code responsible for the tabs corresponding to ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 can be found within the components folder:

- **ERC20:** Located in the `components/tokens/ERC20` directory.
- **ERC721:** Located in the `components/tokens/ERC721` directory.
- **ERC1155:** Located in the `components/tokens/ERC1155` directory.

This structured approach ensures that code and assets are logically grouped, facilitating ease of navigation and maintainability.

#### Understanding the ERC20 Tab Code
The code interacts with a smart contract to mint tRSK tokens. Here's a detailed breakdown of how this is achieved:

1. **Smart Contract Reference:**
  - **Address:** The smart contract's address is specified by the `ERC20_ADDRESS` constant.
  - **ABI:** The contract's ABI (Application Binary Interface), which defines the contract functions and their parameters, is provided by the `abi` constant.

2. **Reading Contract Data:**

  ```javascript
  const { data, isLoading, isError, refetch } = useReadContract({
      abi,
      address: ERC20_ADDRESS,
      functionName: "balanceOf",
      args: [address],
  });
  ```

3. **Writing to the Contract:**
  The `useWriteContract` hook from the wagmi library is used to interact with the contract's write functions (functions that modify the state).

4. **Minting Tokens:**
  The `mintTokens` function calls `writeContractAsync` to mint tRSK tokens. 

 - Arguments:
     - abi: Defines the contract functions and their parameters.
     - address: The address of the deployed ERC-20 contract.
     - functionName: The name of the function to call, which is "mint" in this case.
     - args: An array containing the user's wallet address and the amount to mint (100 in this case).

  ```javascript
  const mintTokens = async () => {
    setLoading(true);
    try {
        const txHash = await writeContractAsync({
            abi,
            address: ERC20_ADDRESS,
            functionName: "mint",
            args: [address, 100],
        });
        await waitForTransactionReceipt(rainbowkitConfig, {
            confirmations: 1,
            hash: txHash,
        });
        setLoading(false);
        toast({
            title: "Successfully minted tRSK tokens",
            description: "Refresh the page to see changes",
        });
        refetch();
    } catch (e) {
        toast({
            title: "Error",
            description: "Failed to mint tRSK tokens",
            variant: "destructive",
        });
        setLoading(false);
        console.error(e);
    }
};

```

This sends a transaction to the blockchain to execute the "mint" function on the smart contract, thereby minting tRSK tokens and depositing them into the user's wallet.

## Understanding the ERC721 Tab Code

This code defines a React component named `ERC721Tab`, which provides a user interface for interacting with an ERC-721 smart contract.

The Key Functions Within This Component:

1. `useReadContract`:
This hook is used to read data from the ERC-721 contract. It fetches the balance of NFTs held by the connected user's address.

- **Parameters**:
    - `abi`: The ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the ERC-721 contract.
    - `address`: The address of the ERC-721 contract.
    - `functionName`: The name of the function to call on the contract (balanceOf).
    - `args`: The arguments to pass to the contract function ([address]).

2. `useWriteContract`:
This hook is used to write data to the ERC-721 contract, specifically to mint a new NFT.

**Function**:
- `writeContractAsync`: Asynchronously writes to the contract by calling the `safeMint` function of the ERC-721 contract.

3. `mintNFT`:
This is an asynchronous function that handles the minting process of a new NFT.

- **Steps**:
   - Sets the loading state to true.
   - Attempts to call the `safeMint` function on the ERC-721 contract using `writeContractAsync`.
   - Waits for the transaction to be confirmed using `waitForTransactionReceipt`.
   - Displays a success toast message if the minting is successful.
   - Refetches the user's NFT balance by calling `refetch`.
   - Catches any errors, logs them, and displays an error toast message.
   - Sets the loading state to false.

4. `refetch`:
This function is part of the `useReadContract` hook and is used to refresh the balance of NFTs after a successful minting operation.

5. `toast`:
This function is used to display toast notifications for success or error messages.

The rest of the component contains JSX to render the UI elements, including a button to mint the NFT, a balance display, and a link to view the minted NFTs on a block explorer.

## Understanding the ERC1155 Tab Code

The code provided is a React component that interacts with a smart contract using the ERC-1155 standard. It allows users to mint tokens and check their balances.

The Key Functions Within This Component:

1. `ERC1155Tab` Component:

**State Variables**:
- `loading`: Boolean to manage the loading state during token minting.
- `value`: Number to store the selected token type for minting.
- `address`: The user's wallet address obtained from the `useAccount` hook.


2. `useReadContract` Hooks:
These hooks are used to read data from the smart contract.

- `useReadContract` for checking the balance of Type A tokens (with ID 1).
- `useReadContract` for checking the balance of Type B tokens (with ID 2).


3. `mintTokens` Function:
An asynchronous function that handles the minting of tokens.

- **Steps**:
   - Calls `writeContractAsync` to interact with the smart contract and mint tokens.
   - Waits for the transaction receipt using `waitForTransactionReceipt`.
   - Displays success or error toasts based on the outcome.
   - Refetches the balance data after minting.
