The Rootstock Dynamic Starter Kit uses the `Wagmi` library for faster integration of Web3 features into a Next.js application. Using `Wagmi` hooks, you can connect to wallets, retrieve balances, transfer tokens, and sign messages. 

At the end of this guide, you’ll know how to set up and configure a Next.js project with Web3 support, connect to different wallets, retrieve data from the blockchain, send transactions to transfer tokens or interact with smart contracts, and securely sign messages to verify user identities. 

Using Dynamic embedded wallet feature in your dApps  simplifies the onboarding experience for your users by abstracting lower-level blockchain interactions, so you can focus on the application layer.

## **What is Dynamic?**

**Dynamic** is a tool that simplifies wallet management and integration for Web3 applications. It provides developers with an "Embedded Wallet" solution, allowing seamless wallet interactions directly within the app without requiring users to switch to external wallet apps.

This makes it easier to create a smooth user experience and improves accessibility, particularly for those new to blockchain.

## **Why Use Wagmi?**

The **wagmi** library offers a set of React hooks specifically designed for Web3 development. These hooks handle essential wallet interactions, such as connecting to MetaMask or WalletConnect, fetching balances, sending tokens, and signing messages. 

## **Key Features**

 1. **Wallet Connection**

This supports connecting wallets like **MetaMask** and **WalletConnect** to provide users with a seamless login into the dApp. MetaMask is a popular browser wallet, while WalletConnect enables connection to a variety of mobile wallets through QR code scanning. With wagmi hooks, handling wallet connections becomes simple, allowing users to securely and easily access the dApp. This removes the need for custom connection logic, making the process quick and straightforward.

2. **Balance Retrieval**

Retrieving token balances is essential for users to monitor their assets. It enables the app to fetch balances for tokens like **RBTC**, **tRIF**, and **DOC** on the Rootstock Testnet. Using wagmi’s hooks, balances are updated in real-time, allowing users to view their holdings within the app. This feature is key for applications where users need to keep track of their assets, such as finance or trading dApps.

3. **Token Transfers**

Token transfers allow users to send assets to other addresses directly from the dApp. This feature lets users select a token, specify an amount, and input a recipient address to complete the transfer. With wagmi’s transaction hooks, token transfers are handled seamlessly, removing the need for complex contract interactions. This functionality is useful for dApps where peer-to-peer payments or transfers are common, like in DeFi or tipping applications.

4. **Message Signing and Verification**

Message signing lets users prove their identity or authorize actions without exposing sensitive information. This feature allows users to sign and verify messages, which is useful for secure authentication or transaction confirmation. Wagmi’s signature hooks streamlines the signing process, providing both security and flexibility for the dApp. It’s especially helpful for applications where identity verification is required.

5. **Rootstock Testnet Support**

This project is preconfigured for the **Rootstock Testnet**, which allows developers to test dApps without spending real assets. By building on the testnet, developers can ensure their dApp is ready for deployment to the mainnet. This provides a risk-free space to experiment with blockchain features, making it ideal for early-stage development and testing.

## **Prerequisites**

This project leverages key libraries to handle server-side rendering, Web3 interactions, and blockchain contract communication. 

Before starting the project, make sure you have these essential tools installed on your computer:

1. **Node.js**:  
   * You’ll need Node.js, version **19.x** or later. Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server, which is required for building and running modern web applications.  
     [Download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/) if you haven't installed it yet.  

2. **Bun** or **Yarn** (recommended for Next.js projects):  
   * **Bun** (version **1.1.x** or later): A fast JavaScript runtime and package manager.  
     See how to [Download Bun](https://bun.sh/).

3. **Next.js**:

   * Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables server-rendered web applications, helping to make your website faster and more SEO-friendly.  
    In this project, Next.js serves as the backbone for building the front end.

4. **Wagmi**:

   * `wagmi` is a collection of React hooks for interacting with Web3, which lets you connect to blockchain networks, handle user authentication, and more.  
   This library makes it easier to integrate Web3 functionality into React components.

5. **Viem**:

    * `viem` provides an easy way to interact with smart contracts on the Rootstock blockchain.  
    This library will be used to connect to Rootstock and make contract calls.
