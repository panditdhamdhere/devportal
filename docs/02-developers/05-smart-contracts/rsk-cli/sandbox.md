The Rootstock CLI (rsk-cli) offers an online sandbox environment within Replit, enabling you to quickly set up and use the CLI without any local installation.

Follow these steps to get started:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Account with Replit">

    Don't have a Replit account yet? Sign up for a free one at [Replit](https://replit.com/).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access the Project">
  
  To access the RSK-CLI project, visit the **[RSK-CLI on Replit](https://replit.com/@rootstockDevX/Rootstock-CLI#README.md)** or click on **Open in Replit** button below.

    This project provides a convenient interface for interacting with the Rootstock blockchain, enabling tasks such as wallet management, balance checking, `RBTC` transfers, and smart contract deployment. 
    
    The Replit environment allows you to run the CLI directly in your browser without requiring any local setup, making it accessible and easy to use.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Fork the Project">
   
    Click on the **Fork** button at the top right of the page to create a copy of the project under your Replit account. 
    
    This step provides a way to make changes and test the CLI without affecting the original project. Free Replit accounts have a limit of 3 active repls. To fork this project and stay within the free tier, you may need to delete an existing repl.

  </Step>
  <Step title=" Run the Project">

    </figure>
    
     Once the project is forked, youâ€™ll see the code editor and the options for running the project.  
    * Click the **Run** button at the top of the page. This will start the CLI and open it in a console window on the right-hand side of the screen.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Interact with the RSK-CLI">

     You should see the CLI interface running in the Replit terminal. Here you can use the CLI commands to test various functionalities like creating a wallet, switching wallets, and executing `read/write` functions.
