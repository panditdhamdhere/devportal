## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Category: Community Events

Community Events contributions focus on creating direct engagement with the developer community to promote Rootstock through high-impact events. There are two types of developer-focused events you can contribute to:
  * Online Events
  * In-Person (IRL) Events

For both categories, you can either:
  * Organize a developer event from scratch, or
  * Represent Rootstock at an external event organized by a third party (e.g. community events, partner meetups, conferences)

### üìå Online Events

Online events are virtual gatherings designed to educate and engage developers around Rootstock‚Äôs technology and ecosystem.

You can contribute by:

* Organizing your own online event, such as:
  * Webinars focused on Rootstock development topics (e.g. using Rootstock SDKs, deploying smart contracts)
  * Interactive office hours or live Q&A sessions for developers building on Rootstock
  * Technical workshops or live coding sessions hosted under the Rootstock brand

* Representing Rootstock at external online developer events, such as:
  * Speaking at a partner‚Äôs developer webinar
  * Participating in online hackathons as a Rootstock mentor
  * Co-hosting educational sessions with other blockchain or developer communities

All online events must be **technical in nature** and targeted at developers interested in learning how to build on Rootstock or integrate its tools.

### üìå IRL Events (In-Person) 

IRL events are physical gatherings where developers represent Rootstock by educating developers in person.

You can contribute by:

* Organizing your own in-person developer event, such as:

  * Hands-on workshops (e.g. building dApps on Rootstock)
  * Developer meetups focused on the Rootstock ecosystem and tooling
  * Academic outreach events at universities or bootcamps

* Representing Rootstock at external IRL events, such as:

  * Delivering technical talks or workshops at developer conferences
  * Mentoring at third-party hackathons where Rootstock is being used
  * Speaking at tech meetups or university events targeting developers


All IRL events must be strictly **developer-focused** and deliver **clear technical value**, helping attendees better understand Rootstock‚Äôs tools, ecosystem, and integration opportunities.

### üìå Criteria & Guidelines

 :::tip[üìå Criteria & Guidelines]
* Events (online or IRL) must be strictly developer-focused and designed to educate, inspire, or support developers in building on or integrating Rootstock.
* Events should deliver clear technical value related to Rootstock tools, services, or ecosystem components.
* All events (online or IRL) must be pre-approved by Rootstock.
* All events (online or IRL) must be recorded, and the recording must be sent to Rootstock for review together with the post-event report.
* A post-event report is required, including metrics such as:
  * Recording link
  * Number of attendees
  * Developer engagement (e.g. questions, feedback, code examples)
  * Qualitative insights (e.g. testimonials or follow-ups)
:::


:::note[‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-Approval Process for Events]

Before committing to an event, contributors must request pre-approval via the submission form. This process ensures alignment on key event details, such as event type, audience profile, format, and clear success metrics (e.g., minimum expected number of participants, engagement goals).

Important: Pre-approval is required to proceed but does not automatically guarantee rewards. Final approval and reward disbursement will only occur if the agreed objectives are fully met. For example, if the pre-approved goal was 50 attendees and only 20 participants attend, the contribution would not qualify for rewards. Ensure expectations are realistic and achievable when submitting for pre-approval.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Flat-Fee Reward Model**:
We do not cover event expenses. Instead, approved events receive a flat reward based on the event type and quality. Pre-approval is required to ensure clarity on expectations and avoid misunderstandings.

‚ö†Ô∏è Geographic Focus for IRL Events:
To start, we‚Äôre prioritizing IRL events in the following cities:
  * New York City, United States ‚Äî North America
  * Buenos Aires, Argentina ‚Äî Latin America
  * Lisbon, Portugal ‚Äî Europe
  * London, United Kingdom ‚Äî Europe
  * Lagos, Nigeria ‚Äî Africa
  * Bengaluru, Mumbai & New Delhi, India ‚Äî Asia-Pacific
  * Seoul, South Korea ‚Äî Asia-Pacific

More locations are on the way, so if your city isn‚Äôt listed yet, stay tuned!
