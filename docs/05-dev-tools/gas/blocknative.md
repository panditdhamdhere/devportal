Blocknative is providing accurate next block gas price estimation for 20+ chains including Rootstock. Use blocknative gas infrastructure to estimate, predict, optimize, and make decisions onchain. 

Supported on: <Shield title="mainnet" tooltip="Available on Mainnet" color="orange" />.

## Key Features

**Accurate Gas Price Predictions:**
* Harness Blocknative’s real-time global mempool data and advanced statistical models to deliver precise gas estimates for next-block or next-ten-second confirmations.

> Need a high probability of being confirmed at the expense of spending extra gas? Use the 99% probability prediction. Don't mind if the transaction takes longer to confirm? Use the 50% probability prediction.

## Getting Started

### How to Sign Up
[Request an API key](https://www.blocknative.com/request-api-key) by filling in the form. A valid Blocknative API key is `OPTIONAL` in the Authorization Header of every request.

:::tip[Tip]

A free API key is recommended for more generous rate limits and future features.

### Set Up the Application

Send a `GET` request which returns a range of confidence intervals for gas prices needed to qualify a transaction for inclusion in the next block or next ∼10 seconds, depending on the chain. The order of confidence intervals is subject to change.

#### Example cURL Requests (if applicable)

```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: optional-apikey-here' 'https://api.blocknative.com/gasprices/blockprices?chainid=30'
```

You should get the following response:

```bash
{"system":"rootstock","network":"mainnet","unit":"gwei","maxPrice":0.1,"currentBlockNumber":7309086,"msSinceLastBlock":20466,"blockPrices":[{"blockNumber":7309087,"estimatedTransactionCount":6,"baseFeePerGas":0.0,"estimatedPrices":[{"confidence":99,"price":0.083,"maxPriorityFeePerGas":0.085,"maxFeePerGas":0.085},{"confidence":95,"price":0.066,"maxPriorityFeePerGas":0.066,"maxFeePerGas":0.066},{"confidence":90,"price":0.066,"maxPriorityFeePerGas":0.066,"maxFeePerGas":0.066},{"confidence":80,"price":0.066,"maxPriorityFeePerGas":0.066,"maxFeePerGas":0.066},{"confidence":70,"price":0.032,"maxPriorityFeePerGas":0.032,"maxFeePerGas":0.032}]}]}%   
```

## Integration process on Rootstock network

To integrate the gas price API in your application, here are example `cURL` requests to get block prices for a default network, and set the confidence levels:

**Example request:**

```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: optional-apikey-here' 'https://api.blocknative.com/gasprices/blockprices'
```

**Without the optional apikey:**

`curl 'https://api.blocknative.com/gasprices/blockprices'`

**Example non-default chain request:**

```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: optional-apikey-here' 'https://api.blocknative.com/gasprices/blockprices?chainid=30'
```
> This returns a range of confidence intervals for gas prices needed to qualify a transaction for inclusion in the next block or next ∼10 seconds, depending on the chain. The order of confidence intervals is subject to change.


**Example custom confidence level request**

```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: optional-apikey-here' 'https://api.blocknative.com/gasprices/blockprices?chainid=1&confidenceLevels=50&confidenceLevels=70&confidenceLevels=80&confidenceLevels=90&confidenceLevels=99'
```

**An alternative format for confidence levels is:**

```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: optional-apikey-here' 'https://api.blocknative.com/gasprices/blockprices?chainid=1&confidenceLevels=50,70,80,90,99'
```
