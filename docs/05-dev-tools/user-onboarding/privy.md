[Privy](https://www.privy.io/) offers a powerful combination of flexibility, security, and developer friendly tools for managing authentication and wallet flows. With extensive configuration options, support for multiple login strategies, and seamless integration with embedded wallets, it adapts to a wide range of environments and use cases. As a secure and customizable solution, Privy is well suited for onboarding users and powering reliable wallet experiences. Integrating it into your app is a strong step toward bringing more users into the Rootstock ecosystem with simplicity and confidence.

Privy handles security at the infrastructure level. Private keys are split using advanced cryptography and never stored in full. Sensitive operations run in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for deep isolation, and the system is backed by SOC 2 certification and regular third party audits.

**With Privy, you can:**
- Design wallet flows
- Integrate authentication and wallet management directly into your app
- Multiple sign in methods, including email, social logins, and OAuth
- Provision embedded, self custodial wallets with crosschain support that fits your productâ€™s needs
- Manage permissions, and choose between out of the box UI components or low level API access depending on your choice of control.
