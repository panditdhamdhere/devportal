**Smart Contract Development** enables developers to harness the power of the **Rootstock** blockchain to create decentralized applications that are secure, transparent, and efficient.

## What is Smart Contract Development?

[Smart Contract Development](/developers/smart-contracts/) involves designing, deploying, and managing contracts that run on the blockchain. These contracts automate transactions, enforce agreements, and power dApps by removing intermediaries.

## How Smart Contracts Work

* **Creation:** Developers write the contract code using programming languages like `Solidity`, defining the rules and logic.  
* **Deployment:** The contract is deployed to the **Rootstock** blockchain, where it becomes immutable and accessible.  
* **Execution:** Once deployed, smart contracts execute automatically when the predefined conditions are met, ensuring trust and transparency.
