Data indexers act like librarians for blockchain data, organizing and storing information in a way that's easy to access. This makes it easier for dApps to get the data needed, which in turn makes dApps faster and more efficient.

## Why are data indexers important?

* Speed: Indexers provide pre-organized data, saving time and resources.
* Performance: They help dApps work efficiently, especially when dealing with a lot of data.
* Scalability: Indexers allow dApps to handle more users and data.
