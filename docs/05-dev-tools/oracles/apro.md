## Get Started

You can use APRO Data Push to connect your smart contracts to asset pricing data. These data feeds aggregate information from many independent APRO node operators. Each price feed has an on-chain address and functions that enable contracts to read real-time pricing data directly from that address.

Visit the [APRO Data Push Documentation](https://docs.apro.com/en/data-push/getting-started) to get started.
