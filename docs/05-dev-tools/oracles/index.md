Oracles act as bridges, securely bringing external data onto the Rootstock blockchain for dApps to utilize.

## How Oracles Work

* Data Request: A dApp sends a request to an oracle network, specifying the data it needs.
* Data Collection: Oracles retrieve the data from reliable sources (weather APIs, stock exchanges).
* Verification: Multiple oracles within the network verify the data for accuracy and security.
* Delivery: The verified data is then delivered to the dApp.
