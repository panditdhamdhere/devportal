RIF Relay is a secure sponsored transaction system that enables users to pay the transaction fees using ERC-20 tokens. This enables end users to transact entirely using one asset instead of having to manage a separate asset for gas.

For general information about RIF Relay, including its design, architecture, and specifications, please refer to the table of contents.
