Rootstock is the first and longest-lasting Bitcoin sidechain. It is the only layer 2 solution that combines the security of Bitcoin's proof of work with Ethereum's smart contract capabilities. The platform is open-source, EVM-compatible, and secured by over 60% of Bitcoin’s hashing power, This robust security model empowers developers to build trustless, innovative dApps within a thriving ecosystem.

This section equips you with the fundamental knowledge required to navigate the Rootstock blockchain. Familiarity with blockchain technology, Bitcoin, and smart contracts will be beneficial as you navigate deeper.
