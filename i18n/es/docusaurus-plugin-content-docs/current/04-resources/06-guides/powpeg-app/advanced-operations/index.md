This section contains detailed instructions on how to perform advanced operations on the PowPeg App.

These operations include;

- How to review funds in Bitcoin after a pegout by [viewing a derived address](/resources/guides/powpeg-app/pegout/deriving-electrum),
- Convert RBTC - BTC and import a [key in Electrum](/resources/guides/powpeg-app/pegout/deriving-electrum#import-key-in-electrum), import in Electrum if you are using [hardware wallets](/resources/guides/powpeg-app/pegout/deriving-electrum#import-key-in-electrum-using-hardware-wallets)
- Selecting different accounts
- Viewing advanced details
- Adjusting network fees
- Viewing Advanced data

## Account selection

### Pegin:

There are three types of accounts on the PowPeg App. See [supported addresses](/resources/guides/powpeg-app/advanced-operations/supported-addresses/) section for examples of these types of addresses.

To select an account to send BTC from, click on **Select the account** as shown in the image below. This loads the balance for all the addresses in your hardware wallet.

> Note: Your hardware wallet must be connected to view this section of the PowPeg App.

Choose the address you want to send TBTC from. See the [getting funds](/resources/guides/powpeg-app/prerequisites#get-funds) section for how to get BTC or TBTC.

### Advanced data

**Unsigned raw tx**

A Bitcoin raw transaction is a chunk of bytes that contains the info about a Bitcoin transaction. That raw transaction will become part of the blockchain when a miner adds it to a block. The pegin transaction has at least one input and two outputs, all information is encoded and displayed for the usersâ€™ verification.

## Adjusting network fees

There are three options to choose from when deciding on which fee rate to use when sending a transaction.

**Slow**

A slow transaction is less expensive and will take longer to confirm.

**Average**

This is also known as normal, here, the transaction is priced at an average rate and will take an average time to confirm.

**Fast**

A fast transaction is the most expensive but the transaction confirms at the quickest time possible.

> The type of fee to be selected depends on several variables, like network speed, time, and amount the user is willing to spend on a single transaction.
