description: The PowPeg App is a user-friendly interface for the conversion of BTC to RBTC and vice versa. It is secured by the powpeg protocol, which is a unique 2-way peg system that allows users to natively transfer bitcoins from the Bitcoin blockchain to the Rootstock blockchain and vice versa, creating a token called RBTC that is pegged to the value of Bitcoin.

:::note\[Notes]

1. Based on the number of Bitcoin block confirmations configured by the LP (currently set at 2 Bitcoin block confirmations for amounts `<= 0.1 BTC`). Bitcoin blocks can take longer to confirm.
2. Based on the number of Rootstock block confirmations configured by the LP (currently set at 10 Rootstock confirmations for amounts `<= 0.1 RBTC`) + 1 Bitcoin block confirmation.
3. An LP can set their own fees.  The initial LP In the PowPeg app has set its provider fee at `0.0001` RBTC so that the LP covers network fees when receiving and rebalancing funds from PowPeg.
4. There is no technical limit for transfers.  It depends on the available liquidity and limitations set by the LP. The initial LP in the PowPeg app, has set the max transfer limits to `0.1 BTC/RBTC`.
