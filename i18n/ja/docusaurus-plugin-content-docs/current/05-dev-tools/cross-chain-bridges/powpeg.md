The PowPeg App, formerly the 2 Way Peg App, allows users to convert BTC to RBTC and vice versa. It is secured by the PowPeg protocol, a unique system that safeguards locked bitcoins using the same Bitcoin hash rate that establishes consensus.

## Transaction Types

- **Peg-in**: Convert BTC into RBTC by locking Bitcoin in a secure multi-signature wallet. After confirmation, an equivalent amount of RBTC is issued on the Rootstock blockchain.
- **Peg-out**: Exchange RBTC back into BTC by burning RBTC on Rootstock and unlocking the corresponding BTC for transfer.

## Why Use the PowPeg App?

The PowPeg protocol is a robust mechanism for ensuring interoperability between Bitcoin and Rootstock. It offers:

- **Security**: Bitcoin's hash rate guarantees asset safety during conversions.
- **Decentralization**: Transactions rely on federated signing, minimizing risks of centralized control.
- **Flexibility**: Enables access to Rootstockâ€™s smart contract capabilities without leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem.
