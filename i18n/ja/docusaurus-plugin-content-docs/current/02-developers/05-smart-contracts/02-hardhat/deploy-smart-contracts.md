In this section, we'll deploy your token contract to your local environment and also deploy and interact with the contract on the Rootstock network.

## Step 1: Configure Deployment File

To configure your deployment file:

- Navigate to the `scripts` directory in the root directory of the quick start repo:

```shell
   cd scripts
```

- In the scripts directory, open the `deploy.js` deployment file:

To deploy `myToken` contract, copy the deployment script below and paste it in your deployment file or see the [`deploy.js` file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsksmart/rootstock-quick-start-guide/feat/complete/scripts/deploy.js) on GitHub.

```js
async function main() {
  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();

  console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);

  const MyToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("MyToken");
  const myToken = await MyToken.deploy(1000);

  console.log("Token address:", myToken.address);
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

## Step 2: Run the Hardhat Network Locally

> Note: You need to have sufficient RBTC in your deploying account for gas fees. See section on [Fund your account](/developers/smart-contracts/hardhat/configure-hardhat-rootstock#step-3-fund-your-accounts).

To run the Hardhat network locally:

- Start the Hardhat network
  - Hardhat comes with a built-in Ethereum network for development. Run the following command in your project's root directory to start it.
    ```shell
    npx hardhat node
    ```
    This command will start a local blockchain network and display a list of available accounts and private keys:
    ![Rootstock Node Running](/img/guides/quickstart/hardhat/run-node.png)
- Deploy your contract to the local network

  - Deploy your contract to the local Hardhat network, in another terminal or command prompt, run the command below in the root directory:

    ```shell
    npx hardhat run --network hardhat scripts/deploy.js
    ```

    This should give a result similar to the following:

    ```shell
    npx hardhat run --network hardhat scripts/deploy.js

    Deploying contracts with the account: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
    Token address: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
    ```

## Step 3: Deploy Your Contract on Rootstock Network

Follow these steps to deploy your contract on Rootstock network:

- Use Hardhat's run command to deploy your contract, depending on the desired network. You can choose to deploy to either Rootstock's Testnet or Mainnet.

To deploy to the Rootstock Testnet, run:

```shell
   npx hardhat run --network rskTestnet scripts/deploy.js
```

This should return the following:

```shell
% npx hardhat run --network rskTestnet scripts/deploy.js
Deploying contracts with the account: 0xA210D04d707f6beBF914Cb1a57199Aebe7B40380
Token address: 0xc6EcBe0F6643825FD1AAfc03BEC999014759a279
```

- To deploy to the Rootstock Mainnet, run:

```shell
   npx hardhat run --network rskMainnet scripts/deploy.js
```

## Step 4: Interact with your deployed contract

To interact with your deployed contract, you can create an interaction script using JavaScript/TypeScript and the [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) library.

- Create a `interact.js` file in the `scripts` directory:

```
   touch scripts/interact.js
```

- Paste the following code in the `interact.js` file:

```js
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  try {
    // Get the ContractFactory of your MyToken contract
    const MyToken = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("MyToken");

    // Connect to the deployed contract
    const contractAddress = "0x543ba9FC0ade6f222BD8C7Bf50a0CD9923Faf569"; // Replace with your deployed contract address
    const contract = await MyToken.attach(contractAddress);

    // Retrieve the balance of an account
    const account = "0x28eb8D29e4713E211D1dDab19dF3de16086BB8fa";
    const balance = await contract.balanceOf(account);

    // Retrieve the symbol of the token
    const symbol = await contract.symbol();

    console.log(
      `Balance of ${account} account: ${balance.toString()} ${symbol}`
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

main();
```

- And run the interaction script. This is how you can do it on testnet:

```
   npx hardhat run scripts/interact.js --network rskTestnet
```

- And this is how you can do it on mainnet:

```
   npx hardhat run scripts/interact.js --network rskMainnet
```

- The expected output by running the interaction script is:

```
   Balance of 0x28eb8D29e4713E211D1dDab19dF3de16086BB8fa account: 1000 MTK
```
